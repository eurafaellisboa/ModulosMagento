## Attract New Customers and be a Trusted Store Owner

The power of **Google Customer Reviews** is that the module allows store owners to request product reviews from shoppers and display them on the site with the help of a special badge. The logic is simple: when you have many customer reviews, shoppers will most likely pay attention to the store. It will increase their confidence to make purchases on your Magento 2 store.

With the friendly functionality of the Google Customer Reviews extension, you can configure script on the store frontend by allowing all needed field configurations from the backend. This module also auto checks the order success page, injecting a piece of script code predestinate for the success page only. The extension is able to work in multiple countries of all continents.

Show off all the advantages of your e-commerce business and encourage potential users to purchase with the help of the powerful [Magento 2 Google Customer Reviews module](https://www.aitoc.com/magento-2-google-customer-reviews.html).

## How does it work?
 
Your buyers get an option to opt-in to receive an email requesting feedback from Google about the experience with your online store. 

In case customers opt-in, they can get such an email after the order has arrived. All ratings are will be displayed on the Google Customer Reviews badge and appear in your Merchant Center dashboard for seller ratings.
